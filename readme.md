With `qemu` installed, just run `./run.sh` to build and run the whole thing.

To build a bootable ISO image, just run `./buildiso.sh`. 

The resulting ISO should work fine in Virtualbox. I've been able to boot it on a real PC using a flash drive, burned from Rufus but have not been able to get it to work with any other ISO-burning software. If you find a way to create a bootable USB drive of this distro using another method let me know!

Currently this is using Aisola's go-coreutils: https://github.com/aisola/go-coreutils
